            Shiva's role as the destroyer is not merely about ending, but about
            transformation and renewal. Tandava, represents the rhythmic cycle
            of creation, preservation, and destruction Shiva is also known as
            "Bholenath," the innocent one, who is easily pleased by devotion.
            who imparts wisdom and guidance to his devotees. Shiva's simplicity
            teaches the beauty of inner richness.
